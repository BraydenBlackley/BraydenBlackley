# 👋 Hi, I'm Brayden Blackley

🎓 **Finance Student @Mcmaster University | Quantitative Modeling & Machine Learning**  
Building a foundation in quantitative finance, data analysis, and algorithmic trading.

I'm currently developing projects at the intersection of **markets, machine learning, and automation** — exploring everything from statistical trading models to Python-based workflow tools.

---

## 🚀 What I'm Working Toward

I'm actively expanding my skills in:

- **Algorithmic & systematic trading**
- **Machine learning for financial prediction**
- **Python automation + data engineering**
- **Backtesting & strategy evaluation**
- **Quant research tools and dashboard development**

My long-term goal is to build a strong portfolio of quantitative tools and applied ML projects.

## 🧪 Projects (Coming Soon)

I’m currently planning and building out the following:

### 📊 **Quant & Trading Tools**
- Python GUI **trading dashboard** (market data, strategy metrics, live/virtual execution)
- **Backtesting engines** in Jupyter (factor models, momentum, breakout systems)
- **Algo trading experiments** with market structure + ML components  
- Research notebooks on volatility, correlations, and portfolio optimization  

### 📚 **Academic & Coursework Projects**
- Applied finance + analytics assignments  
- Machine learning practice models  
- Data visualization & statistical analysis notebooks  

(These will be added as they’re completed — expect regular updates.)
